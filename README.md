## Overview 

This is an investigation of the expression of pseudo opinions in online surveys. 

There is abundant evidence that survey respondents report opinions and attitudes towards things they are wholly unfamiliar with. There are two prominent explanations for pseudo opinions. First, they can be seen as a function of satisficing, i.e., a strategy employed by unmotivated and/or distracted respondents to get through the survey with as little effort as possible. When faced with an unfamiliar topic, a satisficing respondent may just choose randomly ("mental coin flip") or skip the question. The second explanation is that respondents attempt to decipher the unfamiliar topic and relate it to something they are familiar with ("imputed meaning"). Then, their responses can be interpreted as valid opinions towards towards the surrogate topic. 

We test each hypothesis, "mental coin flip" vs. "imputed meaning", by looking at the speed with which the respondents answered each question. A mental coin flip is a satisficing strategy, so it should be accompanied by faster responses. The imputed meaning hypothesis is a deliberate attempt to understand/interpret the question and provide a meaningful response, so it should be accompanied by slower responses. 

We asked respondents to give us their opinion on six fictitious organizations, meanwhile recording their response latencies. Large proportions of the respondents provided substantive responses to wholly fictional organizations (ranging from 7% to 87%, depending on the specific organization and experimental conditions). 

We find evidence for both response behaviours in our study. Pseudo opinions are predicted by both very fast and very slow responses (significant nonlinear effect of response latencies on pseudo opinions). This effect is not confounded by any stable respondent-related characteristics (year of birth, sex, education, etc.), nor by unobserved item-related characteristics (number of words, syllables, etc). 
In a second exploratory step, we observe that males and older respondents tend towards pseudo opinions. The respondent's reported level of political interest strongly predicts pseudo opinions, suggesting a link between them and social desirability: respondents that wish to present themselves as politically informed also avoid admitting they do not have an opinion on obscure issues and topics. 

Providing an explicit 'don't know' category greatly reduces the proportion of pseudo opinions in most cases. Also, instructing respondents to take their time and respond in a deliberate fashion reduces pseudo opinions somewhat. Survey researchers could apply these findings to their projects in an attempt to avoid pseudo opinions.
